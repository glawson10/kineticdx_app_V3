# Staff / Invites / Permissions (V3)

This area is governed by the **authoritative spec**: `docs/CURSOR_SYSTEM_PROMPT_STAFF_INVITES_PERMISSIONS.md`.

- That doc is the single source of truth. If a request conflicts with it, stop and explain why.
- **Execution order:** Propose file list → Cloud Functions first → Firestore rules → Flutter UI. Never refactor unrelated code.
- If ambiguous, ask before changing architecture.

When starting a new chat for this feature, paste the full contents of that doc as the system prompt.
